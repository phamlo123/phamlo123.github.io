It includes new algorithm for selecting options for each trading day to be included in the calculation of synthetic VIX, as well as features for the ML model. Specifically, 30 realized variance is calculated for every trading day from 1996 to 2020 (using SPX spot price) and this will serve as lablels for our model. Each trading day is an observation in our model. And finally, the selected options for each trading day will be aggregated and standardized to be used as features in our model",
